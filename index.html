		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>My PC is my life. I use it everyday for extended periods of time because it is my source of information and entertainment. I got into
			 web design and development because my friends told me to give it a go. I began with Code Academy and w3schools which made me want to pursue
			 this as a profession. I love the challenge coding brings and those little mess ups that make you waste an entire day yet feel so rewarding so fix
			 (even though it might just be a missing semi-colon).
